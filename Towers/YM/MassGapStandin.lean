STAND-IN: Inhabitedness witness for a "mass-gap-lower-bound" predicate
shape. Does NOT prove the Yang-Mills mass gap. YM tower stays
`Status: Open` in `docs/ROADMAP.md`. Surface #1 stays OPEN.

Batch 162.1. Brick that shows the predicate "there is a positive
constant `C` such that the (trivial) tail bound holds against a
positive mass `μ`" is consistent — i.e. that it can be witnessed at
all. This is NOT a proof that any Yang-Mills correlation function
exhibits a mass gap, and is NOT a wiring from the live
`integrated_tail_standin` lemma to a real spectral-gap statement.

Honest scope of this file
-------------------------
* `hasMassGapLowerBound μ`  — predicate: there is a `C > 0` and `μ > 0`.
                              Conjunction-of-positivity inhabitedness
                              predicate, deliberately weak.
* `massGap_standin_example` — witness at `μ := 1`, `C := 1`.

What this file does NOT prove
-----------------------------
* This is NOT a proof of the YM mass gap.
* This file is NOT wired to the live `integrated_tail_standin` lemma
  in `Towers/YM/IntegratedTail.lean` (see deviation below).
* This file does NOT close Surface #1. Surface #1 stays OPEN.

Deviation from the user-supplied snippet
----------------------------------------
The original snippet defined the predicate as

    `∃ C : ℝ, 0 < C ∧ ∀ f, integrated_tail_standin f ≤ C * μ`

This does not typecheck against the actual v4.12.0 signature in
`Towers/YM/IntegratedTail.lean`:

    `lemma integrated_tail_standin (δ T : ℝ) (hδ : 0 < δ)
        (hδT : δ < T) (hT : T ≤ 1) :
        ∃ C : ℝ, 0 < C ∧ ∀ t ∈ Set.Ioc (0:ℝ) T,
          (∫ _s in Set.Ioc δ T, K' t (1 : SU3))
          ≤ C * t ^ (-4 : ℝ) * (T - δ)`

`integrated_tail_standin` is a *lemma producing a witness*, taking
four positional arguments + hypotheses, not a function `f → ℝ`. The
original snippet's `integrated_tail_standin f ≤ C * μ` is therefore
malformed and would not compile.

The honest stand-in here drops the wiring to `integrated_tail_standin`
entirely and lands the conjunction-of-positivity inhabitedness
predicate. A future brick can re-wire to the real lemma once the
predicate shape is reshaped to fit the actual stand-in's signature.

Yang-Mills tower stays `Status: Open` in `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

   Witness-collapse NOT resolvable under Clay rules. `hasMassGapLowerBound`
   is a deliberately-weak conjunction-of-positivity shape; the as-written
   proposition below is trivially satisfiable (C = μ = 1) and says nothing
   about any real mass gap. The genuine YM surface is unreachable in mathlib
   v4.12.0. De-registered from BRICKS. This names the proposition; it does
   NOT prove it. No sorry / no axiom. -/
